# Text-to-Image Generation Application

## Overview

This repository is part of the internship at **Vilearnx Advanced Technologies**. The primary objective of this project is to implement and train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play a complex game by making sequential decisions to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Task Description

**Task Name:** Task 6: Text-to-Image Generation Application

**Objective:**  
The goal of this task is to develop and train an RL agent that can navigate and succeed in a complex game environment by making optimal decisions over time. The agent will learn to maximize cumulative rewards through interactions with the environment.

- **Problem Definition:** Implement a game environment where an RL agent can be trained.
- **Agent Development:** Design and develop the RL agent using appropriate machine learning techniques.
- **Training:** Train the agent within the game environment, iteratively improving its performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the agentâ€™s performance using relevant metrics and refine the model to achieve better results.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Implementation:** Develop an RL agent capable of playing and mastering a complex game.
- **Game Environment Creation:** Build or utilize an existing game environment to train the RL agent.
- **Sequential Decision Making:** Enable the agent to make informed decisions based on state observations to maximize rewards.
- **Python-based Implementation:** Utilize Python and RL libraries like OpenAI Gym, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate the agent's performance using metrics like cumulative reward and success rate.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **RL Libraries:** OpenAI Gym, TensorFlow, PyTorch (or similar)
- **Game Development Tools:** [Specify if any specific tools were used]
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Deployment:** Command Line Interface (CLI)
